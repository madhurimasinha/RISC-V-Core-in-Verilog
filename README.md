**Design of a 32-bit RISC-V Core in Verilog**

RISC-V is a free and open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that follows the RISC design principles. 
ISA is the interface between software and hardware that defines how a processor can execute the instructions and how programs interact with the registers and memory. 
Thus, RISC-V is the blueprint of how a processor should work.

RISC-V's small core, low power usage, and customizability make it ideal for embedded systems and IoT devices like microcontrollers, sensors, wearables, and smart home tech. Companies are adopting it to build custom processors or accelerators, offering flexibility, cost efficiency, and innovation in semiconductor design, free from proprietary limitations.
With no licensing fees, RISC-V offers a significant economic advantage, lowering barriers for startups and high-volume, low-margin businesses. Its clean base ISA and extension mechanism enable custom instructions and features tailored to specific needs while maintaining compatibility. RISC-V combines cost-efficiency, flexibility, and modern design, making it ideal for customizable applications.

This project aims to design a RISC-V processor core in Verilog.
