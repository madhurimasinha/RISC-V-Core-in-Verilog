**Design of a 32-bit RISC-V Core in Verilog**

RISC-V is a free and open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that follows the RISC design principles. 
ISA is the interface between software and hardware that defines how a processor can execute the instructions and how programs interact with the registers and memory. 
Thus, RISC-V is the blueprint of how a processor should work.

This project aims to design a RISC-V processor core in Verilog.
